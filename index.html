How to go back to what you used to have on a website?
Version control!
Like? Git!

Inside website folder type: git init
git status
(Untracked means git has this file but it's not following it)
git add index.html
git status
(Now we are tracking the file)
How to make a save point?
git commit
git status
git commit -m "Add index.html"
git status
Now if you change your file again and save it, git status will know that you've modfied your file.
It knows the version that I have is different from past

git commit -m "Remove frisbee from interests"
git log

Another nice thing about git is github
Github is a host for our projects.
It lets you host basic websites

branch?
Like when you have a new feature and want to try it out and then you can merge them if you liked that feature
switch branches: git checkout branchName
git merge master
git push origin branchName
